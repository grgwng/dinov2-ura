# Depth Pro: Sharp Monocular Metric Depth in Less Than a Second

![Depth Pro Demo Image](https://github.com/apple/ml-depth-pro/raw/main/data/depth-pro-teaser.jpg)

We present a foundation model for zero-shot metric monocular depth estimation. Our model, Depth Pro, synthesizes high-resolution depth maps with unparalleled sharpness and high-frequency details. The predictions are metric, with absolute scale, without relying on the availability of metadata such as camera intrinsics. And the model is fast, producing a 2.25-megapixel depth map in 0.3 seconds on a standard GPU. These characteristics are enabled by a number of technical contributions, including an efficient multi-scale vision transformer for dense prediction, a training protocol that combines real and synthetic datasets to achieve high metric accuracy alongside fine boundary tracing, dedicated evaluation metrics for boundary accuracy in estimated depth maps, and state-of-the-art focal length estimation from a single image.

Depth Pro was introduced in **[Depth Pro: Sharp Monocular Metric Depth in Less Than a Second](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02073)**, by *Aleksei Bochkovskii, Amaël Delaunoy, Hugo Germain, Marcel Santos, Yichao Zhou, Stephan R. Richter, and Vladlen Koltun*.

The checkpoint in this repository is a reference implementation, which has been re-trained. Its performance is close to the model reported in the paper but does not match it exactly.

## How to Use

Please, follow the steps in the [code repository](https://github.com/apple/ml-depth-pro) to set up your environment. Then you can download the checkpoint from the _Files and versions_ tab above, or use the `huggingface-hub` CLI:

```bash
pip install huggingface-hub
huggingface-cli download --local-dir checkpoints apple/DepthPro
```

### Running from commandline

The code repo provides a helper script to run the model on a single image:

```bash
# Run prediction on a single image:
depth-pro-run -i ./data/example.jpg
# Run `depth-pro-run -h` for available options.
```

### Running from Python

```python
from PIL import Image
import depth_pro

# Load model and preprocessing transform
model, transform = depth_pro.create_model_and_transforms()
model.eval()

# Load and preprocess an image.
image, _, f_px = depth_pro.load_rgb(image_path)
image = transform(image)

# Run inference.
prediction = model.infer(image, f_px=f_px)
depth = prediction["depth"]  # Depth in [m].
focallength_px = prediction["focallength_px"]  # Focal length in pixels.
```

### Evaluation (boundary metrics) 

Boundary metrics are implemented in `eval/boundary_metrics.py` and can be used as follows:

```python
# for a depth-based dataset
boundary_f1 = SI_boundary_F1(predicted_depth, target_depth)

# for a mask-based dataset (image matting / segmentation) 
boundary_recall = SI_boundary_Recall(predicted_depth, target_mask)
```
